## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about some basic styling such as box shadow, flex box and a little bit of media queries.

```css
/* Flex box */
.parent{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
```css
/* Box shadow */
.container{
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 7px 0px rgba(142, 140, 140, 0.619);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about different uses of flex box. Doing this project I realized I have very little idea of how to use media queries. So I will learn a lot about media queries.
